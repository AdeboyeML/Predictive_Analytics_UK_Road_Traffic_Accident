# Predictive_Analytics_UK_Road_Traffic_Accident


#### This project entails performing in-depth descriptive analysis and data visualization on the United Kingdom road traffic (2000 - 2018) and accident dataset (2005 - 2014) and further forecasting / predicting the rate of accident for the next two years based on the available time series dataset.

#### It is recommended to view the notebook in using [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) as most of the plots and figures are interactive, the nbviewer links for each category (notebook) is provided below.

### This project is broken down into 3 categories:

#### 1. Road Traffic Analytics and Visualization [uk_road_traffic](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/AdeboyeML/Predictive_Analytics_UK_Road_Traffic_Accident/blob/master/UK_Traffic_Analysis_Visualization.ipynb)
#### 2. Road Accident Analytics and Visualization [uk_road_accident](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/AdeboyeML/Predictive_Analytics_UK_Road_Traffic_Accident/blob/master/UK_road_accident_analytics.ipynb)
#### 3. Timeseries forecasting of the rate of road accident in UK for the next 2 years. [TimeSeries Forecast](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/AdeboyeML/Predictive_Analytics_UK_Road_Traffic_Accident/blob/master/UK_Road_Accident_Timeseries_Forecasting.ipynb)
